    "# Experiment: Anwendung von N-Gramm-Regeln aus TinyStories auf Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "Dieses Experiment basiert auf der Arbeit von **Timothy Nguyen** und untersucht, wie gut N-Gramm-Regeln, die aus dem **TinyStories**-Datensatz extrahiert wurden, die **Vorhersagen eines Transformer-Modells** für einen **anderen Datensatz (Wikipedia)** approximieren können. Das Experiment wurde in einem Jupyter Notebook implementiert und die Ergebnisse werden visualisiert, um die Übertragbarkeit der Regeln zu testen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Hintergrund\n",
    "\n",
    "Im Originalpaper von **Nguyen et al.** wird untersucht, wie gut N-Gramm-Regeln die Vorhersagen von Transformer-basierten Modellen beschreiben können, insbesondere auf dem **TinyStories**-Datensatz. Diese Regeln werden auf das Modell angewendet, um deren **Vorhersagen zu approximieren**. Im vorliegenden Experiment wird diese Methodik auf **Wikipedia** angewendet, um zu testen, wie gut die Regeln aus einem anderen Datensatz (TinyStories) auf **fremden Text** übertragen werden können.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Ziele des Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TinyStories-Regeln auf Wikipedia anwenden**:\n",
    "    - Berechnung der **Top-1 Accuracy** und **Variationsdistanz** zwischen den Modellvorhersagen und den N-Gramm-Regeln.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Vergleich der Ergebnisse**:\n",
    "    - **TinyStories** vs **Wikipedia**:\n",
    "      - Vergleich der Modellvorhersagen auf dem eigenen Datensatz (TinyStories) und dem fremden Datensatz (Wikipedia) mit den N-Gramm-Regeln.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualisierung der Ergebnisse**:\n",
    "    - Darstellung der **Top-1 Accuracy** und der **Variationsdistanz** für beide Datensätze.\n",
    "    - Vergleich der N-Gramm-Regeln auf beiden Datensätzen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Vorgehensweise\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Vorbereitung der Daten\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wikipedia-Daten**: 100 zufällige Sätze wurden aus dem **Wikipedia-Datensatz** (20220301.en) extrahiert und tokenisiert.\n",
    "- **TinyStories-Daten**: N-Gramm-Regeln wurden aus den **TinyStories-Daten** extrahiert, um Vorhersagen zu erstellen und mit den Modellvorhersagen zu vergleichen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Modellvorhersagen und Regelvorhersagen\n",
    "\n",
    "- Für jeden Satz in Wikipedia und TinyStories wurde das **nächste Token** durch das Modell vorhergesagt.\n",
    "- Es wurden ebenfalls **Regelvorhersagen** für das nächste Token berechnet, basierend auf den N-Gramm-Häufigkeiten aus den **TinyStories-Daten**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Metriken\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-1 Accuracy**: Wie oft stimmen die **Top-1 Vorhersagen** des Modells und der Regeln überein?\n",
    "- **Variationsdistanz**: Wie ähnlich sind die Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen der Modellvorhersagen und der Regelvorhersagen? (Berechnet mit dem L1-Abstand)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Visualisierung der Ergebnisse\n",
    "\n",
    "Die Ergebnisse der Metriken für **TinyStories** und **Wikipedia** wurden in **Balkendiagrammen** visualisiert, um den **Vergleich der beiden Datensätze** zu zeigen.\n",

    "# Zusammenfassung\n",
    "Auswahl und Anwendung der N-Gramm-Regeln\n",
    "In diesem Experiment wird die bestmögliche Approximation der Modellvorhersagen durch N-Gramm-Regeln aus dem TinyStories-Datensatz untersucht. Dazu werden alle verfügbaren Regeln aus den offiziellen Daten einbezogen, unabhängig davon, ob sie auf reinen Suffixen $R_{\\text{suffix}}$, Teilkontexten $R_{\\text{subgram}}$ oder auch marginalisierten Kontexten $R_{\\text{all}}$ basieren.\n",
    "\n",
    "Konkret wird für jede Modellvorhersage auf Wikipedia diejenige TinyStories-Regel gesucht, deren Vorhersage die geringste Variationsdistanz zur Modellverteilung aufweist. Dies entspricht methodisch dem Ansatz aus dem Paper, bei dem die bestmögliche Regel aus dem gesamten Regelraum Rallₘ ausgewählt wird (vgl. Paper, Tabelle 2).\n",
    "Begründung:\n",
    "Da die Regeln in den offiziellen Daten bereits vorgegeben sind und nicht explizit klassifiziert wurden, wird keine Einschränkung auf spezifische Regeltypen vorgenommen. Ziel ist es vielmehr, zu analysieren, wie gut TinyStories-Regeln generell auf Wikipedia übertragbar sind, wenn man stets die beste verfügbare Regel auswählt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dieser Ansatz liefert eine obere Schranke der Approximation durch N-Gramm-Regeln und erlaubt so eine fundierte Einschätzung der Übertragbarkeit einfacher statistischer Regeln auf fremde Domänen.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Auswertung der Ergebnisse\n",
    "Ziel dieses Experiments war es, zu untersuchen, wie gut N-Gramm-Regeln, die aus dem TinyStories-Datensatz extrahiert wurden, die Vorhersagen eines Transformer-Modells approximieren können – sowohl auf dem originalen TinyStories-Kontext als auch auf fremden Wikipedia-Daten.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TinyStories** (eigener Datensatz)\n",
    "- Ø Top-1 Accuracy: **0.283**\n",
    "- Ø Variationsdistanz: **0.702**\n",
    "\n",
    "Die Regeln erzielen auf TinyStories eine mäßige Top-1 Accuracy, treffen also in rund 28 % der Fälle die gleiche Vorhersage wie das Modell. Die durchschnittliche Variationsdistanz ist mit 0.702 relativ hoch, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Regelverteilungen und Modellverteilungen häufig deutlich voneinander abweichen. Dies ist konsistent mit den Ergebnissen aus dem Paper, das zeigt, dass einfache N-Gramm-Regeln transformerbasierte Verteilungen nur näherungsweise beschreiben können.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wikipedia** (fremder Datensatz)\n",
    "- Ø Top-1 Accuracy: **0.059**\n",
    "- Ø Variationsdistanz: **0.675**\n",
    "\n",
    "Auf Wikipedia sinkt die Top-1 Accuracy drastisch auf etwa 6 %. Die Regeln aus TinyStories treffen also fast nie die Vorhersage des Modells auf Wikipedia-Daten. Interessanterweise ist die Variationsdistanz hier niedriger als bei TinyStories, was zunächst kontraintuitiv erscheint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diese geringere Distanz entsteht jedoch, weil viele Regelverteilungen auf Wikipedia flach und unspezifisch sind. Sie ähneln zufällig den (ebenfalls unspezifischen) Modellverteilungen in neuen Kontexten, was zu einer geringeren Differenz führt – ohne tatsächliche inhaltliche Übereinstimmung.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpretation\n",
    "Die höhere Distanz auf TinyStories zeigt, dass Regeln oft präzise, aber falsch sind (z. B. Vorhersage mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit, aber falsches Token).\n",
    "\n",
    "Die niedrigere Distanz auf Wikipedia ist nicht Ausdruck besserer Passung, sondern eher ein Zeichen für unspezifische, verwaschene Verteilungen, die zufällig näher beieinanderliegen.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fazit\n",

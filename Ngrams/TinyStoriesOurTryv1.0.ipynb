Beep was a healthy car because he always had good fuel. Good fuel made Beep happy and strong.\\n\\nOne day, Beep was driving in the park when he saw a big tree. The tree had many leaves that were falling. Beep liked how the leaves fall and wanted to play with them. Beep drove under the tree and watched the leaves fall on him. He laughed and beeped his horn.\\n\\nBeep played with the falling leaves all day. When it was time to go home, Beep knew he needed more fuel. He went to the fuel place and got more healthy fuel.

I am cold and I don\\'t feel fine.\"\\n\\nFin felt sad but wanted to help the crab feel better. He swam away and thought of a plan. He remembered that the sun could make things warm. So, Fin swam to the top of the water and called to the sun, \"Please, sun, help my new friend feel fine and not freeze!\"\\n\\nThe sun heard Fin\\'s call and shone its warm light on the shore. The crab started to feel better and not so cold. He saw Fin and said, \"Thank you, little fish, for making me feel fine. I don\\'t feel like I will freeze now.

#Instructions 

you activate this by opening GitBash and 
```bash
bash jupyterTunnel.sh
´´´

#Activate your enviroment in the server (ask for gpu is you want) and then use the normal jupyter lab command.
After the server iniates you can type 

´´´bash http://localhost:8888
´´´
#On your browser to open Jupyter lab, it might ask for a token, you cant find it on the logs
of that the jupyter server prints when initializing something like 

´´´bash https:1.1.20.30.20.token=sakdjsalkfjlq2321094823094jofj is it quite long.
´´´

you want to use sakdjsalkfjlq2321094823094jofj as token in this example.
